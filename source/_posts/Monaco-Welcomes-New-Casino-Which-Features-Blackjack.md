#  Monte Carlo Adds Blackjack To Its Casinos Amidst Calls For Regulation

Las Vegas, Nevada - January 1st, 2018

Amidst the recent call by some for blackjack to be regulated in the state of Nevada, Monte Carlo has announced that it will be adding blackjack tables to its casinos. This move comes as a bit of a surprise, as blackjack is seen as one of the most heavily regulated casino games.

A spokesperson for Monte Carlo said that the company has been monitoring the calls for regulation and decided that it was time to add blackjack to its casinos. "We believe that our guests will appreciate having the option to play blackjack at our properties," said the spokesperson. "And we believe that this will show our commitment to providing a safe and enjoyable gaming experience for all of our guests."

The news comes as a blow to proponents of regulation, who had hoped that increased regulation would help to clean up the industry. One state legislator expressed disappointment with Monte Carlo's decision, saying that it was "yet another indication that the industry is unwilling to change its ways."

#  Third casino in Monaco to offer blackjack

The Monte-Carlo Sporting Club, one of the three casinos in Monaco, is set to offer blackjack starting from the end of February. The game, which has been absent from the principality’s casinos for more than 10 years, will be available daily from 4pm to 6am.

The move is part of an effort by the casino to attract new players and revive interest in its gaming offering. Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, with betting limits ranging from €1 to €10,000.

ADVERTISEMENT “We are always looking for ways to innovate and improve our offer for our customers,” said Michel Pastor, Director of Gaming at the Monte-Carlo Sporting Club. “Blackjack is a hugely popular game and we are confident that it will be well received by our guests.”

The other two casinos in Monaco are the Casino de Monte-Carlo and Le Sporting d’été. All three casinos are operated by Societe des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des Etrangers à Monaco (SBM), a private company owned by the government of Monaco.

#  Monaco's tables turning green: blackjack added to casinos

Monaco has long been a playground for the world's wealthiest, with its casinos and luxury hotels. Now the tables are turning a bit greener as blackjack is added to the mix.

The principality's 28 casinos will offer blackjack in addition to roulette, craps, poker and other table games. The Monte Carlo Casino is adding an extra table just for blackjack.

The move is an effort to attract a new generation of players and keep up with rivals such as France and Italy, which have been expanding their gambling offerings in recent years. Gambling is a big business in Monaco, accounting for more than 10 percent of its economy.

"We are trying to modernize Monaco's image a little bit," said Stéphane Valeri, director of gambling operations at the Monaco government.

Blackjack is popular because it is relatively easy to learn and offers gamblers some chance of winning even if the odds are against them. It also has a lower house edge than some other table games.

Casinos in Monaco already offer slots and electronic gaming machines, but they make up the majority of casino revenue. Blackjack should bring in more revenue from players who like betting on more complex games with better odds than slots offer.
