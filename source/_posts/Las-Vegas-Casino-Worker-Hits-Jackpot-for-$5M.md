#  Las Vegas Casino Worker Hits Jackpot for $5M

LAS VEGAS--A worker at one of the city's casinos hit the jackpot for $5 million this week, according to officials.

The unidentified casino employee was reportedly scanning cards at a blackjack table when they hit the big win.

"I am so happy for that person," said fellow casino worker Vincent Perez. "I can't imagine what they must be feeling."

This is not the first time a casino worker in Las Vegas has hit it big. In fact, just last year a slot attendant won nearly $2 million.

Casino workers in Sin City often enjoy some of the best perks in town, including free meals, discounted hotel rooms, and even complimentary spa treatments.

In addition to the many benefits, casino jobs are also relatively low-stress and often offer employees flexible hours.

So if you're looking for a fun and exciting career that comes with some great rewards, consider working in a Las Vegas casino.

#  Woman Tops Progressive Slot Machine for $343,000

A woman visiting the Wynn in Las Vegas hit a $343,000 jackpot on a progressive slot machine early Thursday morning, according to casino officials.

The woman, who has not been identified, was playing the Wheel of Fortune slot machine when the top jackpot came up.

“We are thrilled that one of our guests hit the top progressive jackpot on Wheel of Fortune and won such a large sum of money,” Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver said in a statement.

The Wynn is one of several casinos in Las Vegas with progressive slot machines that offer larger top prizes for players who hit designated combinations.

The woman was playing at about 1:30 a.m. when she hit the jackpot, Weaver said. She was given a ceremonial cheque for her winnings and photo op on Thursday afternoon.

#  Atlantic City Casino Dealer Wins $250,000 on Slot Machine

The Press of Atlantic City reports that Denise McMullen won $250,000 playing a Wheel of Fortune slot machine at Bally's casino on the Boardwalk.

Last September, McMullen won nearly $180,000 playing a different slot machine at the same casino.

Both wins were unexpected.

"I never think I'm going to win when I play these things," McMullen said Tuesday. "I just hope to break even."

The 49-year-old mother of four says she plans to use her latest winnings to pay off some bills and take a vacation with her family.

#  Californian Grabs Record-Breaking $8.15 Million from Slot Machine

The Californian casino goer has beaten the odds – and set a new world record in the process – by scooping an amazing $8.15 million from a slot machine.

The lucky player, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was playing at the Pechanga Resort and Casino near Temecula when they hit the massive jackpot.

This breaks the previous world record of $7.68 million, which was set by an Australian player in 2015.

“I was absolutely shocked,” said the Californian after claiming their winnings.

They added: “I couldn’t believe it… I still can’t believe it!”

The slot machine that paid out the record-breaking sum is called Lightning Link and is notorious for its big payouts. In fact, over the last twelve months it has paid out over $170 million to players.

This isn’t the first time that someone has won big on Lightning Link either; in January 2018 a player took home $3.2 million from the game.

It is not yet known what the lucky Californian plans to do with their windfall, but they are likely to have plenty of choices open to them!
