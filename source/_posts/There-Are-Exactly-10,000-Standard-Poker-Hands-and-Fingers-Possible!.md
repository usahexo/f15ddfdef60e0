#  How Many Different Poker Hands and Fingers Are Possible?

Poker players know that the possible number of hands they can be dealt is 52. But how many different poker hands are possible when using all 10 fingers?

The answer is, surprisingly, 10,000. This is because there are 10 different ways to make each hand, with each combination of two cards (A-2, 3-4, etc.) yielding a unique hand.

This figure is arrived at by multiplying the number of different cards in a deck (52) by the number of different hands that can be made from those cards (10). So for every possible poker hand combination (e.g. A-2), there are five other combinations that produce a different hand altogether (e.g. 3-4).

When it comes to fingers, there are 10 fingers total, which means that each finger has 100 possible combinations. This includes cases where both hands are the same (left hand and right hand), as well as mixed combinations (e.g. left hand four fingers and right hand thumb).

So how do we use this information? Well, if you're ever playing poker and want to psych out your opponents, try making some strange bets based on the weird and wonderful combinations of fingers that they might be holding!

#  There Are Exactly 1024 Poker Hands and Fingers Possible!

Who would have thought that when playing poker there are exactly 1024 possible hands? This is calculated by multiplying the number of cards dealt (52) with the number of fingers on one hand (10). So, even if you’re dealt a “bad hand”, there are plenty of other possibilities waiting to be drawn.

Interestingly, the odds of being dealt any given hand are 1 in 2.6 million. However, the chances of being dealt a royal flush are only 1 in 649,740. In order to increase your chances of winning big, it’s important to know which hands rank higher than others.

Here is a list of the 10 best possible poker hands, starting with the highest ranking first: royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, three of a kind, two pair, one pair and high card.

#  There Are Exactly 52 Poker Hands and Fingers Possible!

There are 52 Poker hands possible. Most people don’t realize that there are also exactly 52 fingers on 2 human hands! This is because we have 4 fingers on each hand, and there are 4 suits in a deck of cards. So, if you want to know the probability of being dealt any particular poker hand, just divide by 52!

The odds of being dealt a Royal Flush (one of the strongest hands in poker) is 1 in 649,739. That might seem daunting, but remember that there are 52 Poker hands possible, so the odds of being dealt any other hand are much higher! In fact, the odds of being dealt any other specific hand are as follows:

1/13 = 7.69% for a straight

1/4 = 25% for two pair

1/2 = 50% for a single pair

3/5 = 60% for three-of-a-kind

4/7 = 57.14% for a full house

5/8 = 62.5% for four-of-a-kind
