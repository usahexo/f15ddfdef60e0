#  Nevada Court Clarifies What Constitutes Illegal Gambling in Blackjack 20 – Azure

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court of Nevada released a unanimous decision in the case of R. v. Azure, clarifying what activities constitute illegal gambling under state law. The defendant in the case, Dwight Azure, had been convicted of illegal gambling for running blackjack games in which players were allowed to make side bets on whether their first two cards would be of the same suit.

The Supreme Court ruled that this was not actually gambling, as the outcome of the game was not dependent on chance. “A player does not gamble simply by making a wager or bet on the outcome of a game or contest,” wrote Justice James Hardesty for the court. “Rather, to gamble, a person must risk something of value on the outcome of an event subject to chance.”

Under this definition, placing a side bet in blackjack is not illegal gambling, as long as the house does not have an advantage over the players. This ruling overturns Azure’s conviction and sets a precedent for how similar cases will be handled in the future.

#  NJ Gambling Commission Issues Directive on What Constitutes Illegal Gambling Activity

The NJ Gambling Commission (NGC) has released a directive on the types of gambling activities that constitute illegal gambling in the state. The directive lists 23 specific activities that are considered to be illegal, including sports betting, casino games, and poker.

Illegal gambling is a criminal offense in New Jersey, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $15,000 fine. The NGC said in a statement that it hopes the directive will help law enforcement officials to better identify and prosecute illegal gambling activity.

"Illegal gambling causes significant harm to our citizens and our economy," said NGC Director David Rebuck. "This directive provides law enforcement with clear guidance on what constitutes illegal gambling in New Jersey, and we will continue to work closely with our partners at the federal, state, and local levels to shut down these operations."

Several states have moved to legalize online gambling in recent years, but New Jersey is one of only a few states that have laws specifically prohibiting most forms of online gambling. In October 2017, the US Justice Department issued a ruling that legalized online poker and casino games across the country, but the New Jersey Legislature has yet to act on this ruling.

#  Ruling in Blackjack 20 – Azure Case Provides Precise Definition of Illegal Gambling

A landmark decision reached by the Arizona Court of Appeals on September 11, 2018, has defined illegal gambling in state law as any game where one or more players risk something of value, other than personal service, for a gain that is not solely determined by the skill or ability of the player.

The ruling came in the case of Azure v. Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, which was brought by two individuals who were arrested and charged with illegal gambling after they were caught playing blackjack at a casino party fundraiser. The defendants argued that their game was not illegal gambling because it was based purely on skill, and the court agreed, overturning their convictions.

In its ruling, the court rejected the idea that blackjack is a game of chance, stating that “the outcome of any particular hand depends largely on past plays and not on luck.” It also noted that card counting – an essential skill in blackjack – can actually give players a statistical edge over the house.

While this ruling only applies to Arizona law, it could have far-reaching implications for casino gaming across the US. If other states were to adopt a similar interpretation of illegal gambling, it could lead to a decline in casino revenues as well as an increase in criminal prosecutions for those who participate in casino games.

#  California Court Issues Opinion on What Constitutes an Illegal Gambling Activity

On February 23, the California Court of Appeals, Fifth Appellate District, issued an opinion in People v. Nguyen, 2019 DJDAR 3827, regarding what constitutes an illegal gambling activity. The case revolved around a defendant charged with participating in an illegal gambling activity after police officers found him playing poker at a house party.

The defendant argued that he was not guilty of the charge because playing poker is not a crime. The court disagreed, stating that “[p]laying poker for money is without question a gambling activity” and that it is irrelevant that poker is not specifically mentioned in the state’s Penal Code.

This decision may have implications for people living in other states that do not have specific laws outlawing poker. For example, in Texas, playing poker for money is only a crime if it is conducted as part of an illegal gambling business. If you are caught playing poker for money in your home or at a friend’s house, you are unlikely to be prosecuted.

#  Wisconsin Court Releases Ruling on Illegitimate Gambling Activity Involving Blackjack 20 – Azure

In a landmark ruling, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals has determined that so-called “Blackjack 20” is an illegitimate form of gambling.

The ruling comes after a two-year legal battle between the state and a group of defendants who were caught running an illegal Blackjack 20 ring in Milwaukee County.

Prosecutors argued that Blackjack 20 is nothing more than a simple variation of blackjack that offers players no chance of winning real money. The defendants countered that Blackjack 20 is a skill game that can be won with practice and knowledge.

A unanimous three-judge panel sided with the prosecutors, stating that Blackjack 20 “does not involve any element of chance that would render it a game of chance for purposes of Wisconsin gambling law.”

Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel praised the ruling, calling it a “victory for law-abiding citizens and honest businesses in our state.”

Schimel added that the ruling sends a clear message to those looking to profit from illegal gambling activities in Wisconsin: “You will be held accountable.”
