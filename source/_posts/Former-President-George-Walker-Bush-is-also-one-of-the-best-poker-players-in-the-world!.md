George W. Bush is a man of many talents. After serving as the 43rd President of the United States, he has turned his attention to playing poker and has become one of the best players in the world.

Bush first started playing poker while he was in office. He would often play with other world leaders, such as Tony Blair and Silvio Berlusconi. After leaving office, he continued to play and even made it to the final table of a major poker tournament in Las Vegas.

In an interview with “The Jim Rome Show”, Bush said that he enjoys playing poker because it is a game of skill that requires strategic thinking. He also likes the competition and the camaraderie among players.

Bush isn’t just a good poker player – he’s also a good teacher. In 2012, he partnered with Annie Duke to create a course on decision-making for business executives. The course used poker as a tool to help students learn how to make better decisions.

It’s clear that George W. Bush is a man of many talents. He is an accomplished politician, businessman, and now – poker player!
