#  PSG falls to 2nd place in Ligue 1 after loss to Lyon 

After PSG's 2-1 loss to Lyon on Sunday, they have fallen to second place in Ligue 1. This is the first time that PSG has not been in first place since the beginning of the season. 

Lyon came into the match with a lot of confidence, as they had not lost in their last six matches. PSG was missing some key players, including Neymar and Kylian Mbappé. 

The first goal of the match came from Lyon's Memphis Depay in the ninth minute. PSG was able to equalize in the 27th minute with a goal from Marco Verratti. However, Lyon was able to score again in the 59th minute with a goal from Lucas Tousart, which ended up being the winning goal. 

With this loss, PSG is now tied on points with Monaco for first place, but Monaco has a better goal difference and is currently in first place.

#  Neymar & Co. slip to second after draw with Strasbourg 

Neymar and company slipped to second in Ligue 1 after a scoreless draw with Strasbourg on Saturday. The result means PSG are now just a point clear of Monaco, who secured a 3-1 win over Lille earlier in the day.

Edinson Cavani had the best chance of the game for PSG, but he was denied by goalkeeper Benoît Costil midway through the first half. Neymar also came close with a free-kick near the end of regulation, but his effort sailed just wide of the target.

The result keeps PSG’s unbeaten run in Ligue 1 intact, but they will need to get back to winning ways if they want to retain their title. Their next game is a clash with Lyon at the Parc des Princes.

#  PSG drops to 2nd after shock defeat at Nantes 

Paris Saint-Germain had to come from behind twice to salvage a 2-2 draw against Nantes on Sunday, but the result wasn't enough to keep them at the top of Ligue 1.

Nantes took the lead in the first half through Kalifa Coulibaly, before Neymar equalized with a penalty in the second. Guillaume Gillet restored Nantes' advantage shortly after, but Edinson Cavani converted another spot-kick to salvage a point for PSG.

However, Lyon's victory over Toulouse later in the day means that PSG now sit in second place, three points behind their rivals.

#  Surprise! PSG falls to 2nd in French league after 5th loss of the season 

Paris Saint-Germain suffered a 2-1 home defeat against Strasbourg, which saw the club fall from first to second in the French Ligue 1 standings. This is PSG’s fifth loss of the season and their second in a row.

Edinson Cavani scored the opening goal for PSG in the 38th minute, but goals by midfielder Jonas Martin and striker Nuno Da Costa earned Strasbourg all three points.

It is only the fourth time that PSG have lost at home in the league since Qatar Sports Investment took over the club in 2011. The result means that they are now one point behind league leaders Lille, who have a game in hand.

“We made some big mistakes and we were punished. They had two shots on target and they got two goals,” said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. “Now we have to pick ourselves up and get back to work. We need to start winning again as quickly as possible.”

French champions PSG had been hoping to bounce back from their 3-2 Champions League last 16 first leg defeat away at Manchester United, but they will now have to do so in order to hold onto their title crown.

#  Unranked PSG falls to 2nd place in Ligue 1 after mediocre play

Unranked PSG falls to 2nd place in Ligue 1 after mediocre play. Marseille, who was unranked just a few matches ago, came up big this past weekend against much-favored PSG to take over the top spot in the league.

Though they have some of the world’s most talented players, including Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, PSG has not been playing up to standard as of late. Neymar has been particularly lackluster, with some fans calling for him to be benched.

It will be interesting to see how PSG fares in Champions League this year. They are considered one of the favorites to win the tournament, but if they don’t improve their play soon, they may not even make it out of their group.
