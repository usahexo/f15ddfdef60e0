#  When I try to follow a link, it takes me to Slut Roulette. How do I make it stop?

First and foremost, it is important to remember that there is no one definitive solution to this problem. Different people may have different ways of solving it, so it is important to find the method that works best for you.

One possible solution is to install an ad blocker. Ad blockers are software programs that can be used to prevent advertisements from appearing on web pages. This can include not only ads displayed by traditional advertising networks, but also social media widgets and trackers. Installing an ad blocker can help to reduce the number of unwanted links that appear on web pages, and can help to make browsing the internet more safe and secure.

Another possible solution is to use a different browser. Different browsers have different default settings, and some browsers are more likely than others to be targeted by advertisers and other unwanted links. If you are experiencing problems with links taking you to unexpected pages, try using a different browser. This may help to solve the problem without having to install additional software.

Finally, it is always recommended that you exercise caution when browsing the internet. Be aware of which websites you are visiting, and be especially cautious when clicking on links. If something looks suspicious or too good to be true, it probably is - avoid clicking on those links!
