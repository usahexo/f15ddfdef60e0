#  Phillies land superstar outfielder in blockbuster trade

The Phillies wasted no time in rebuilding their outfield, landing superstar Bryce Harper in a blockbuster trade with the Nationals on Thursday.

The Nationals were reportedly looking to move Harper after they re-signed Patrick Corbin and acquired Brian Dozier this offseason.

The Phillies will send Wilson Ramos, their first round pick in the 2019 draft, and $10 million to the Nationals for Harper.

This is a major win for the Phillies, who have now added one of the best players in baseball to an already young and talented roster.

Harper is coming off of a down year where he hit just .249 with 24 homers and 86 RBIs, but he has still averaged 34 homers and 98 RBIs over his six-year career.

He gives the Phillies another dangerous bat in the middle of their lineup and should help them compete for a playoff spot in 2020.

#  Phillies sign free agent ace to bolster starting rotation

The Phillies have agreed to a deal with free agent ace pitcher Patrick Corbin, according to league sources.

The 29-year-old left-hander is coming off a career season in which he went 11-7 with a 3.15 ERA and 246 strikeouts in 33 starts for the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Corbin reportedly received six-year offers from multiple teams, but opted for a six-year, $140 million deal with the Phillies.

The move gives the Phillies one of the top rotations in baseball, joining Aaron Nola, Jake Arrieta and Zach Eflin.

It's also another huge win for general manager Matt Klentak, who has now added two of the top free agents on the market in Corbin and outfielder Bryce Harper.

#  Phillies acquire veteran shortstop to lead infield

The Philadelphia Phillies announced today that they have acquired veteran shortstop Jose Reyes from the Miami Marlins in exchange for minor league pitcher Matt Barnes and infielder Danny Espinosa.

Reyes, a four-time All-Star, is coming off a down year in which he batted just .269 with seven home runs and 37 RBIs in 113 games for Miami. However, the 33-year-old is still considered one of the most dynamic players in the game and brings a wealth of postseason experience to a Phillies team that is looking to make a playoff run in 2017.

"Jose is a player we've coveted for a long time," said Phillies general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. "He's a difference maker and can really help us take the next step."

Barnes, 22, was selected by Philadelphia in the first round of the 2011 draft and has pitched sparingly at the major league level over the past two years. Espinosa, 27, was acquired by the Phillies from Washington last offseason and hit .234 with 13 home runs and 38 RBIs in 125 games for Philadelphia last year.

#  Phillies bolster bullpen with several key signings

For the Phillies, it was all about shoring up the bullpen for the upcoming season.

On Thursday, they signed former Royals reliever Kelvin Herrera to a two-year, $18 million contract. The signing came just one day after they inked another reliever, Andrew McCutchen, to a three-year, $50 million deal.

Herrera recorded 123 strikeouts in 80 innings last season for the Royals, good for an impressive strikeout rate of 15.1 batters per nine innings. He joins a bullpen that already includes Tommy Hunter and Pat Neshek.

“Kelvin is one of the best relievers in baseball and brings a wealth of postseason experience to our club,” general manager Matt Klentak said in a statement released by the team. “He elite stuff and is someone who can pitch in any situation. We are excited to add him to our bullpen.”

The Phillies also agreed to terms with outfielder Jay Bruce on a three-year, $39 million contract on Thursday. Bruce hit .254 with 36 home runs and 101 RBIs last season for the Mets and Indians. He provides much-needed power to Philadelphia’s lineup and could slot into the cleanup spot behind Rhys Hoskins.

With these signings, it appears that the Phillies are poised for another run at the playoffs in 2019.

#  Phillies poised for another run at the World Series

The Phillies surprised many people last season by making it all the way to the World Series. This year, they are poised for another run at the title.

One of the main reasons for their success last year was their pitching staff. Led by ace Roy Halladay, the Phils had one of the best pitching rotations in baseball. This year, they are even better, with Cliff Lee joining the team in addition to Halladay and Cole Hamels.

The offense is also looking good. Ryan Howard and Chase Utley are two of the most potent hitters in baseball, and they will be joined this year by new acquisition Roy Oswalt.

All in all, the Phillies look like a team that is primed for another championship run.
