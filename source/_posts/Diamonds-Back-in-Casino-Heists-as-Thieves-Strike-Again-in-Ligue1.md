#  Diamonds Back in Casino Heists as Thieves Strike Again in Ligue1

In a coordinated heist on Saturday, diamond thieves stole millions of dollars worth of jewels from a casino in southern France. This is the latest in a spate of such robberies in recent months, as diamond thieves have made a return to casinos after years of absence.

The thieves entered the casino at around 2am and smashed display cases containing diamonds and other jewels before making their escape. Initial reports put the value of the stolen diamonds at around €5 million, but this is likely to rise as investigators assess the damage.

This is the second major heist on a French casino in as many months. In January, thieves made off with over €1 million worth of jewels from a casino in Cannes. This follows a series of high-profile diamond thefts from casinos in Europe over the past few years.

What is behind this resurgence in diamond theft? One possible explanation is that thieves are taking advantage of increased security at airports and other transportation hubs to smuggle diamonds out of the country. Another possibility is that falling commodity prices are making diamonds an easier target for theft.

Whatever the reason, it is clear that casino owners need to take steps to protect their valuable assets. Diamond theft can be difficult to prevent, but using security cameras and other measures can help deter criminals from targeting your property.

#  Is the Return of Diamonds in Casino Heists Signalling a New Wave of Crime?

The recent diamond heist at the Carlton hotel in Cannes has baffled detectives and left the public wondering – could this be the start of a new wave of casino crime?

The raid, which saw several million euros worth of diamonds stolen from the display case of the hotel's jewellery store, is just the latest in a spate of high-profile casino robberies.

In just the past year, there have been thefts from casinos in Geneva, Las Vegas and Macau, with criminals making off with millions of dollars in jewels and cash.

So why are casinos becoming such a target for thieves? And what can be done to prevent these crimes from happening?

Experts say that one of the reasons casinos are becoming a target for thieves is because they are seen as being an easy target. notoriously difficult to protect, with large sums of money and valuable items on display. Security cameras and guards can only do so much to prevent a determined thief from making off with their loot.

Another reason is that casinos offer a very high potential return on investment. With large amounts of cash floating around and few security measures in place, it's no wonder that criminals are targeting them.

What can be done to prevent casino heists?

Casino owners can take a number of steps to make their premises less appealing to thieves, including increased security measures such as CCTV and security guards, as well as more careful monitoring of money and jewellery. They can also make sure that valuables are kept in secure locations away from public view.

#  Bandits Steal Millions in Diamonds from French Casino 

On the morning of January 9th, a group of bandits entered the Casino de Paris in the heart of downtown and made off with millions of dollars worth of diamonds. The robbery occurred just after the casino had opened for the day, and security guards were still in the process of setting up cameras and other security measures. 

The thieves were able to make their way into a secure room where the diamonds were being kept, and they managed to escape with a haul that is estimated to be worth more than 8 million euros. This is one of the largest diamond heists in recent French history, and it is still not clear how the robbers were able to get away with such a large amount of diamonds without being caught. 

One possibility is that they had help from someone inside the casino who was able to provide them with access to the diamond room. Another theory is that they managed to smuggle some of the diamonds out of the casino in disguised as something else. 

The police are currently investigating the heist, and they are asking for anyone with information about what happened to come forward. They are also urging casinos across France to increase their security measures in order to prevent future robberies from taking place.

#  Heists Continue as Criminals Steal Another Batch of Diamonds from French Casino 

January 26, 2018- Just a few months after a daring diamond heist at the Carlton Intercontinental Hotel in Cannes, France, another batch of diamonds was stolen from a casino in the city. The latest robbery occurred at the end of last week at the Midi Casino, when thieves made off with an estimated €2 million worth of gems.

This brings the total amount of diamonds stolen in the French Riviera since July to more than €10 million. In both robberies, thieves managed to get away with their haul despite being surrounded by security cameras.

Investigators have not released any information about possible suspects in either robbery. However, they are believed to be linked, as they both involved teams of well-dressed men who used similar tactics. 

Police are still trying to determine how the thieves were able to bypass security at both casinos. They believe that someone on the inside may have been helping them, but so far they have no evidence to support this theory.

This latest robbery has left casino operators in the region on edge. Many are now increasing security measures, including adding more cameras and hiring more security personnel. 

While it is unclear exactly what the thieves plan to do with all these diamonds, it is clear that they are becoming increasingly brazen in their attempts to rob jewelry stores and casinos. Authorities are urging anyone with information about these robberies to come forward so that they can catch the criminals before they strike again.

#  Why Are Criminals Returning to Diamond Theft in French Casinos?

The French Riviera is a globally renowned destination for luxury and wealth, and the casinos located in its glamorous coastal towns are among its most popular attractions. But the glitz and glamour of the French Riviera's casino scene is now being overshadowed by a new trend in criminal activity: diamond theft.

In early 2018, three men were caught attempting to steal diamonds worth €2 million from the Casino of Cannes. This was just one in a string of high-profile diamond thefts from French casinos in recent months. In December 2017, two men stole diamonds worth €1 million from the casino in Saint-Tropez. In January 2018, a man made off with diamonds worth €500,000 from the casino in Menton.

So what's behind this resurgence in diamond theft at French casinos?

There are a few possible explanations. One possibility is that criminals are simply taking advantage of lax security at French casinos. Another possibility is that France's continued economic prosperity is making diamonds a more attractive target for robbery. And finally, it's possible that the spate of diamond thefts at French casinos is simply symptomatic of an overall increase in global crime rates.

Whatever the explanation may be, one thing is clear: French casinos need to do more to protect their customers and their assets from diamond thieves.
