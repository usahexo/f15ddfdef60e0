#  Vavada Adds Bitcoin as a Deposit Method

Casino gaming platform Vavada has announced that it will now allow players to deposit and withdraw funds in bitcoin. According to the announcement, this makes the casino one of the first in the world to offer this payment option.

The addition of bitcoin comes as part of a larger effort by Vavada to provide a comprehensive range of payment methods for its players. These include credit cards, bank transfers, and Skrill, among others.

Speaking about the new addition, a spokesperson for Vavada said: “We are always looking for ways to improve our service and expand the options available to our players. Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly popular payment method, so we felt it was important to offer it as a deposit option.”

The spokesperson added that players can use bitcoin for both deposits and withdrawals, making it a convenient option for those who want to keep their transactions private.

Vavada is not the only casino that is adding support for bitcoin payments. In recent months, several other operators have announced similar plans, including BitStarz, mBit Casino, and PlayAmo Casino.

This trend is likely to continue as bitcoin becomes more widely accepted as a payment method. In fact, analysts believe that bitcoin will soon become a mainstream form of payment, especially in the online gaming industry.
