#  Betfair Casino Bonus Just How to Withdraw Rabona

The Betfair Casino bonus is just one of the most popular bonuses around. It's simple to redeem and offers you cash to play with as soon as you make your first deposit. Wagering requirements are reasonable, and there are plenty of games available in which to fulfil them. But what about withdrawing that bonus?

It's actually very easy to do. You'll need to have met the wagering requirements for the bonus, which are typically 35x the bonus amount. Once you have, simply go to the 'withdrawals' section of your account and select 'Betfair Casino Bonus' from the list of available withdrawals.

You'll then be asked to choose how much of the bonus you'd like to withdraw -remember, it must be at least £10-. Once you've made your selection, press 'Submit' and your withdrawal will be processed promptly.

Bear in mind that not all games contribute equally towards meeting the wagering requirements - slots count 100%, but blackjack only counts 20%. So it's a good idea to stick to slots if you're looking to meet those requirements quickly.

That's all there is to it! So why not take advantage of Betfair Casino's great welcome bonus and see how much fun you can have with your extra cash?

#  Tips for withdrawing your Betfair Casino bonus

When you sign up for a Betfair Casino account and make your first deposit, you will be eligible for a welcome bonus. This bonus is a percentage of your deposit, and can be as high as £200. To withdraw your bonus, you will need to meet certain wagering requirements.

Here are some tips for withdrawing your Betfair Casino bonus:

1) Make sure you understand the wagering requirements. Each casino has its own set of requirements, so be sure to read them carefully before you start playing. In general, you will need to bet a certain amount of money before you can withdraw your bonus.

2) Choose the right games. Not all games contribute equally towards meeting the wagering requirements. In general, slots contribute 100%, while table games contribute only 10%. So, if you want to meet your wagering requirements as quickly as possible, stick to slots.

3) Take advantage of bonuses and promotions. Many casinos offer bonuses and promotions that can help you meet the wagering requirements faster. So be sure to take advantage of these offers whenever possible.

4) Be patient. Meeting the wagering requirements can take time, so don't get discouraged if you don't meet them immediately. Just keep playing and eventually you will meet them.

5) Use the cash out function sparingly. If you cash out too often, you may not have enough money left to meet the wagering requirements. So try not to cash out until you have almost met the requirement so that you can maximize your earnings.
