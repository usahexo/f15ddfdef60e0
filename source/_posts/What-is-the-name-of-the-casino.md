The Great Pyramid was built over a 20-year period using around 2.3 million blocks of stone.

#  What is the minimum age for gambling? 

Gambling is the wagering of money or something of value on an event with an uncertain outcome with the goal of winning money or material goods. Gambling is often considered a form of recreation or entertainment, but it can also be a serious problem when it becomes an addiction.

In many parts of the world, gambling is legal for adults over a certain age. The minimum age for gambling varies from country to country, but typically it is 18 years old or older. Some countries have a higher minimum age for gambling, such as 21 years old in the United States.

There are some exceptions to the minimum age for gambling. In some cases, minors may be allowed to gamble if they are accompanied by an adult. In other cases, particularly in online gambling, there may be no minimum age requirement at all. It is important to check the laws in your country before you gamble to make sure you are following the correct age requirements.

#  What are the opening hours?

When it comes to opening hours, there can be a lot of variation from one business to the next. Generally speaking, most stores open somewhere between the hours of 7am and 10am, and close between the hours of 6pm and 9pm. However, there are always exceptions, so be sure to check with your preferred store before making any assumptions. Some stores may be open later on Fridays or Saturdays, for instance, while others may be closed on Sundays altogether.

# What are the holiday hours?

Just as with regular hours, holiday hours can vary a great deal from one business to the next. Generally speaking, most stores will either have reduced hours or will be closed altogether on major holidays like Christmas Day or New Year's Day. Again, be sure to consult your preferred store in order to get specific information about their holiday hours.

# What are the special event hours?

Many retail businesses offer special event hours in addition to their regular and holiday hours. These events can include Black Friday sales, seasonal discounts, and more. To find out about special event hours for your preferred store, be sure to check their website or contact them directly.
