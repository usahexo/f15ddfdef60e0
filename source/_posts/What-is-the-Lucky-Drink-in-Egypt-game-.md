#  What are the Lucky Drink in Egypt game rules? 

Lucky Drink in Egypt game is one of the most popular board games in Egypt. The game is a race game for two or more players, each of whom starts with nine pieces, which are moved around the board according to the throw of a six-sided die. The aim of the game is to be the first player to move all of their pieces home.

The game is played on a square board, divided into squares, with a “start” square in the middle and four corner squares. Each player has nine pieces, which are usually represented by small plastic animals or cars. One die is used to determine how each piece moves.

Players throw the die and then move their pieces clockwise around the board according to the number shown on the die. If a player lands on an opponent’s piece, they may captured it and remove it from the board; if they land on their own piece, they may either exchange it for another piece or “jump” over one or more opponent pieces to an unoccupied square. The winner is the first player to move all of their pieces home. 

There are a few variations of the game, depending on where you play it. In some versions, players only have six pieces and must capture all of their opponents pieces in order to win; while in others, players can move any number of spaces as long as they follow the movements dictated by the die (so they could potentially move more than one space at a time).
